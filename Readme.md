ðŸ‘‰ Que:2 Why we should not use static variable insdie any method as local variable ?

-> static variable are associate with the class
-> they are initialized only once
-> when the class is loaded tehy are initialized
-> and tehy retain their value throughtout  lifetife of program

-> local variable have limited scope -- static variable have scope in entire class
-> local variable are access only insiode the method -- where as static variable throught the class
-> local variable lyfetime is short -- where as life time of static variable is till then till the calss is loaded 
-> local variable are initialized everytime when the methods are called -- where as static variable is initialized is only onces and their value is shared among all instances
